* 
* v 2.1 added desciprtive text and cleaned up debugging
* v 2.2 added hostname option and lookup ip if blank.
* v 2.3 added better checking for end of send to make sure it is closing cleanly
* v 2.4 add serial queueing so that a new connect waits while old finishes.. set timeout to 1 minute to wait. if email is not finished by
*       then close connection and start new one. Also add state.lastCommand to follow the attribute as that seems more reliable.
* v 2.4.1 ignore stream is closed errors in telnetStatus fx as the is a system callback and is not working correctly , intermittantly i get a call
*       to this function telling me socket is closed but it obviously is not because responses are still asynchronously coming basck after!
*      This "Stream is closed" messages seems to always come out after the quit command so it appears to be a status message not really an error
* v 2.4.2. try to workaround the check i had for the goodbye/bye message .. I was checkiong the value string on code 221 which was not a good
*          approach as various servers can return differnent strings here. Unfortunately 221 just means remote server is closing so need to checkt
*          that the message was sent and it is 221,
* v 2.4.3 true concurrency and queue using a thread safe data structure concurrentlinkedqueue and also mutex (thanks to erktrek)
*         tested with up to 8 messages
*         When one message finishes it checks the queue, and delivers any other remaining.. also schedules a rerun when busy and one is added to the queue.
*         also serialize the setting and checking of the state.lastCommand as this is used to keep track of the async status of the commands
* 
*  v 2.5 changes were enough to signify new version. Found one bug in last one when reviewing code. a synchronize inside a synchronize on same semaphore.
*         Did not seem to be causing issues so I assume the system is smart enough to avoid it but fixed anyway.
* v 2.5.1 mine got stuck in weird state and kept re-running with failure.. added an unschedule to fix it in certain cases and reset states. Also removed a function no longer called.
*         Also reset state variable when it finds queue empty.
* v 2.5.2 change password input type to password from text
* v 2.5.3 auto turn off logging after 1/2 hour
* v 2.5.4 change formatting of date header
* v 2.5.5 change time formatting yet again.
* v 2.5.6 put extra lines in send to try to get around error in hubitat 2.2.5
* v 2.5.7 removed extra lines as bug is 2.2.5 and nothing to do with the lines.
* v 2.5.8 fixed email.. as summized version 2.2.5 telnet is stripping of extra lf or cr that are needed for email
* v 2.6 played with carriage return line feeds to get message back on first line..
* v 3.0 after recent release hubitat seems much slower getting the initial connect to the telnet port and therefore messages are stacking up .
* for this reason instead of queuing and trying 30 seconds later I have added a random component so it will queue and try 30 + 1-60 secs later.
* v 3.1 add desc. logging option default is on.. only a few lines of info come out when debugging is off. One for each email and a couple of others if queued up.
* this turns all that off.
* NOte: just noticed that if you send a bunch of message to the queue and also at the same time to another instance of the driver (ie another notification device) the queue
* is not distince. Meaining that all run in one process/thread.. The assumption is that each would be independent. Not the case . So the wrong device can get a message sent but it is rare.
* will look at somehow appending the device id to the queue and ignoring those not for you, but that is a big change .
* v 3.2 only one of the /r/n was needed before the body.. m
* v 3.3 got mms working from AT&T yeah.. so that we now can get all the msgs in one thread instead of the random number.
*
* V 3.4
* very very complicated. Spend about 6 hours on it.. here are my findings:
* 1. the date header must be there and in a specific format. It is so picky time zone must be in -0500 etc format not EST.
* 2. all FROM and TO emails must be in the form kahn@lgk.com <kahn@lgk.com>. It automatically constructs this so don't enter them that way.
* 3. there must be headers for Message-ID , also enclosed in <>, MIME-Version, Content-Type, and Content-Transfer-Encoding.
* If any of these are missing or wrong the mms doesn't work from AT&T and you get an error email back.
* This thing is so damn picky and there is no documentaton on it whatsoever.
* Send some Beers my way.. What a pain the Ass Hopefully in works for everyone on your existing servers. If not let me know!
* It was also complicated to generate the unique message id. GetHubUuid() did not work. 
* It works without a unique id, but I tried to generate one anyway. It uses a random UUID from a javascript function
* concatenated with the number of secs since midnight 1972 etc.
*
* v 3.5 Some email servers did not like the "email" <email> format, so trying just <email> in the recpt to and from headers.
*
* v 3.5.1 as someone pointed out the character map on hubitat is utf-8 not ascii so some special characters in emails were not being displayed correctly.
* v 3.6 noticed while i was having internet problems that the app kept spawning off retrying forever.. Notice the 2 attempts was not working.
* fixed it so it gives up after two failed attemps. also unchedules all pending and resets and tries again.
* v 4. add optional ehlo for servers that require it. Also need to handle the additional processing of EHLO informational messages coming back.
