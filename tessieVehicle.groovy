 *
 * initial release 1.0 beta 1/13/24
 *
 * v 1.1 1/14/24 Added:
 * all to seat heater option, and change name of close Trunk to open or close Trunk to be clearer as it is actually a toggle,
 * also added following commands:
 * set Seat Cooling
 * start Defrost
 * stop Defrost
 * remote Start
 * Close Sunroof
 * and list Drivers
 *
 * Obviously not all commands work with all vehicles, for instance many have no 3rd row seats, or steering wheel heater, or cooling seats or auto close trunk etc.
 * 
 * update for version 1.5 1/17/24
 * v 1.6 clean up debugging
 * 
 * v 1.7 add some vehicle config attributes: car_type, has_third_row_seats, has_seat_cooling, has_sunroof
 * and check these when trying commands and print warning when using these commands if car does not have that feature.
 *
 * v 1.8 check difference of current time vs last response time for car.. if greater than user inputed time in seconds. 
 * then do a status command instead of state.. and see if car is asleep .
 * if it is asleep change scheduled refresh to do a status until it is awake. then change back to the normal state.
 *
 * Relating to this is a new attribute currentVehicleState that can be checked..
 *
 *  v 1.81 change default for timeout to 300 from 90 as tessie seems to take longer to determine vehicle is asleep to save on api calls.
 *  also add code to check if temp is null before trying conversion from far. to celc. and vice versa.
 *
 * v 1.82 force vehicle status to be awake after wakeup call so we get a full refresh.. otherwise it would wake up on first refersh and require a 2nd refresh before
 * getting data.
 *
 * v 1.9 typo in state.reducedRefreshDisabled kept it from working.
 * v 1.91 handle speed of 0 interpeted as null.
 * v 1.92 new attribute savedLocation
 * v 1.97 handle state offline better. just report it dont try to process any data.
 * v 1.98 4/30/24 add command to get battery health (which shows battery degradation) and fill in related attributes, add option to get this data on very query either never, on every refresh or only on reenable if using that.
 *        since this is not really needed all the time, recommend if using set to only-on-reenable (assuming you use the sleep at night option to save on queries).
 *        this adds the following attributes: batteryCapacity, batteryOriginalCapacity, batteryDegradation, batteryHealth.
 * v 2.0 add following attributes active_route_destination, active_route_minutes_to_arrival thanks Alan_F
 * v 2.01 round minutes to arrivate to 2 decimal digits
 * v 2.02 it was truncating to whole integer instead of 2 digits for minutes to arrival... fix
 *    also added active_route_miles_to_arrival and active_route_energy_at_arrival
 * v 2.03 round miles to arrival to 1 digit past decimal.
 *
 * v 2.1 many changes. first integration using the new tesla/tessia fleet streaming API. Thanks to  Bloodtick_Jones and ALAN_F for initial code stub.
 *
 * Caveats, this is a little different that the non official version:
 *
 * 1. There is a new input preference flag that needs to be enabled to use the web fleet websocket API. Without this it works just like it used to albeit alternate presence sensing will
 * now NOT work without the websocket API. So all the code and preference flags for reduced refresh are gone and the minimum refresh time is 1 minute. The Reason being is that
 * this methods works much better for frequent data updates to figure out when you are close to home to set whether you are present or not. This is also enabled with a setting.
 * As before alternate present uses your home longitude and latitude and the distance you decide it should fire.. Without all these set it will flag an error in the logs and disable it.
 *
 * There is also a new debug toggle just for the new websocket api, if either this or the older debug_level=full are on websocket debugging will come out. This is so that if issues
 * arrise with the new code you don't have to commit to full debugging of the polling api as well.
 *
 * the following functions and attributes and related input preference have been removed:
 *        input "outerBoundryCircleDistance", 
 *        input "outerRefreshTime", 
 *        input "refreshOverrideTime",
 *
 * FromTime and ToTime settings are still relavent to disable polling and also now will disable the websocket api interface during this time as well. This normally is used
 * when you know the car will not be used ie. late at night to help it sleep and also reduce load on the hub. If the websocket interface is enabled it will also now re-enable
 * when the daily toTime is met.
 *
 * A timeToFullCharge attribute that displays the remaining time to charge (NOTE the name is misleading) it is not really the time to full charge but the time remaining to charge up- to the
 * level you have set. But anywhoo this is what telsa has called this attribute. The attribute is a string similiar to what is found in the tesla app.
 *
 * Other notes: Beyond our control is that the websocket interface seems to reset every 5 minutes, and in order to fill in missing data on intial startup or when this occurs 
   (as long as the car is NOT Asleep) a normal polling refresh is fired off.  The result is that you will see normal refreshes every 3 minutes if the car is awake.
 * For this reason, normal polling probably should not be set lower than 10 minutes, 15-30 minutes is now the recommended level for the normal API polling.
 *
 * v 2.11 fix typo in disable fx
 * v 2.12 fromtime was not disabling the websocket correctly, the status fx was reopening it.
 * v 2.13 timetofullcharge fixes
 * v 2.14 change to present not to set if already same state.
 * v 2.15 extra debugging in charging timestring removed, and also debugging that was supposed be info and was
 *     coming out related to new alt presence code, changed to only come out for full debugging. 
 *     Also removed old code for alt presence that was already commented out.
 *  v 2.16 fix set_temp
 *  v 2.17 change of debug to say when we set presence to false, also dont reset presence to either true or false 
 *    from the websocket api when useAltPresence is true.
 *
 * v 2.18 bug in temperatures from websocket.. zero coming back and was not getting converted correctly to 32 degress
 *   as apperently wherever the function celsiusToFahrenheit 
 *   has a bug and just returns 0 (probably a check for null = 0 issue, i had to hard code to 32 in this case.
 *   the prior result was when temp was coming back in websock as 0 it was getting set to fahrenheit 0 instead of 32.
 *   
 *   Also a second issue/special case.. vehicle speed comes back as invalid:true if car is not moving and sometimes the speed gets left set to the previous value
 *   in this case if if is invalid assume it is also 0 and set it to that as well as set motion to false.
 *   I have reported this to tessie and if they fix this in the legacy code I can then remove this hack.
 *
 *   Also add back altpresence setting of present in legacy code processing without reducded refresh as some legacy cards cannot
 *   use websocket telemetry. To use this there is a new input preference that needs toi be enabled:useAltPresenceWithLegacyAPI.
